# LV2 plugins are installed in a "bundle", a directory with a standard structure. Each bundle has a
# Turtle file named `manifest.ttl` which lists the contents of the bundle.
#
# Hosts typically read the manifest of every installed bundle to discover plugins on start-up, so it
# should be as small as possible for performance reasons. Details that are only useful if the host
# chooses to load the plugin are stored in other files and linked to from `manifest.ttl`.
#
# In a crate, this should be a special folder that contains the Turtle files. After the crate was
# build, the resulting shared object should also be copied into this folder.
# 
# #### URIs
#
# LV2 makes use of URIs as globally-unique identifiers for resources. For example, the ID of the
# plugin described here is `<https://github.com/RustAudio/rust-lv2/tree/master/docs/amp>`. Note that URIs are only used as identifiers
# and don't necessarily imply that something can be accessed at that address on the web (though that
# may be the case).
# 
# #### Namespace Prefixes
#
# Turtle files contain many URIs, but prefixes can be defined to improve readability. For example,
# with the `lv2:` prefix below, `lv2:Plugin` can be written instead of 
# `<http://lv2plug.in/ns/lv2core#Plugin>`.

@prefix lv2:  <http://lv2plug.in/ns/lv2core#> .
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .

# #### Describing a Plugin
#
# Turtle files contain a set of subject-predicate-object statements which describe resources. 
# 
# Firstly, `<https://github.com/RustAudio/rust-lv2/tree/master/docs/amp>` is an LV2 plugin:

<https://github.com/RustAudio/rust-lv2/tree/master/docs/amp> a lv2:Plugin .

# The predicate `a` is a Turtle shorthand for `rdf:type`.
#
# The binary of that plugin can be found at `<amp.ext>`:
<https://github.com/RustAudio/rust-lv2/tree/master/docs/amp> lv2:binary <libamp.so> .

# This line is platform-dependent since it assumes that shared objects have the `.so` ending. On
# Windows, it should be ending with `.dll`. Relative URIs in manifests are relative to the bundle 
# directory, so this refers to a binary with the given name in the same directory as this manifest.
# 
# Finally, more information about this plugin can be found in `<amp.ttl>`:

<https://github.com/RustAudio/rust-lv2/tree/master/docs/amp> rdfs:seeAlso <amp.ttl> .
