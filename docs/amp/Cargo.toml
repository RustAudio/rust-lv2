# Rust-LV2 is a network of individual sub-crates with different version numbers and histories.
# However, most plugins don't need to deal with them directly. Instead, they use the re-export crate
# simply called `lv2`. It has an optional dependency to every sub-crate, which can be enabled via crate features.
# 
# The default feature set includes everything to create a simple plugin for audio and MIDI processing.
# Therefore, we don't need to enable extra features here.
