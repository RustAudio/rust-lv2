# Rust-LV2's C header bindings.

Bindings to the official [LV2](https://lv2plug.in/) API headers, used by [`rust-lv2`](https://crates.io/crates/lv2), a safe, fast, and ergonomic framework to create [LV2 plugins](http://lv2plug.in/) for audio processing, written in Rust. The crate uses the version 1.18.0 of the specification, as pulled from the [project's website](https://lv2plug.in/lv2-1-18-0.html).
