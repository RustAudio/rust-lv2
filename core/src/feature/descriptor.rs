/// type.
/// If the given pointer is null, this function returns `None`.
///
/// This function does an additional check to handle the case where the reference is null but the
/// Feature type is zero-sized (examples include `HardRTCapable` or `InPlaceBroken`).
/// If that is the case, a reference to a dummy value is returned instead, which is just as invalid
/// to read but is non-zero at least.
///
/// C LV2 hosts legitimately do this because they have literally nowhere to point to, but in Rust
/// creating a null reference is instant Undefined Behavior even if the reference itself is never
/// read and/or zero-sized (e.g. because of `Option`).
///
/// # Safety
///
/// This function may create an reference to a value that isn't of type `T`. Therefore, you should be cautious when you use it.
///
/// The validity of this method currently under debate and may be replaced soon.
