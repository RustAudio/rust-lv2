//! Types to declare derivable port containers.
//!
//! Every plugin has a type of [`PortContainer`](trait.PortContainer.html) which is used to handle input/output ports. In order to make the creation of these port container types easier, `PortContainer` can simply be derived. However, the macro that implements `PortContainer` requires the fields of the struct to have specific types. These types are provided in this module.
